If you look at that data sheet, you'll notice that the temperatures are defined to 4 significant digits ($25.00^o C$, for example), and the kinematic viscosity changes significantly with temperature.  In our lab, however we don't have the capacity to control the temperature of our fluid nearly to this high degree of accuracy.  Instead, we'll fit a curve to this known data, which will allow us to estimate fairly accurately the viscosity of the N35 standard at any temperature.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/Viscosity_and_Uncertainty/raw/main/Images/viscosity_reference_data.png width = 400>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Viscosity, though, is tricky: as a function of temperature, viscosity does not fit a \"standard\" (linear, exponential, or polynomial) curve.
