Where do we go from here?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Let's think about the calibration process in a simpler case, and compare it to what we are doing here.  When we calibrate a load cell, for example, we used known reference standards for force as an input  (masses pulled down by gravity).  The load cell $transduces$ that input into an output: voltage.  And so we created a plot with the input on the x-axis and the output on the y-axis:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/Viscosity_and_Uncertainty/raw/main/Images/voltage_force.PNG width = 300>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","When we calibrate the load cell, we fit a curve to the voltage vs. force data points to find the *sensitivity* of the load cell to force, in units $V/N$.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Now let's think about the current problem.   What is our known input?  It is the quality of the reference standard that we know: the kinematic viscosity.  And what is this input transduced into?  In other words, how does this input become \"readable\"?   It becomes readable as a time.  So our calibration plot, with input on the x-axis and output on the y-axis, should look like this:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src = https://github.com/MAugspurger/Viscosity_and_Uncertainty/raw/main/Images/viscosity_time_dynamic.PNG width = 300>\n","</center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","So we want to take data in a way that leads to a plot of this form.
